# Cafe Management System (WPF)

The Cafe Management System is a desktop application developed using C#, LINQ, Entity Framework, and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It provides a comprehensive solution for managing the operations of a cafe, including menu management, order processing, customer management, and reporting.

## Features

- Menu Management: Create, update, and delete menu items with details such as name, description, price, and availability. Categorize menu items into different sections for easy navigation.

- Order Processing: Place and process customer orders, including adding items to the order, modifying quantities, and calculating the total amount. Manage order statuses such as "pending," "in progress," and "completed."

- Customer Management: Maintain a customer database with information such as name, contact details, and order history. Retrieve customer information for order processing and customer relationship management.

- Reporting: Generate reports and analytics on sales, popular menu items, revenue, and customer preferences. Utilize LINQ queries and Entity Framework to extract data from the database and generate meaningful insights.

- Loyalty Program: Implement a loyalty program module to reward customers for their frequent visits and purchases.

## Technologies Used

- C#: The primary programming language used for developing the application logic and implementing business rules.

- LINQ: Utilized for querying and manipulating data in the database, enabling efficient data retrieval and processing.

- Entity Framework: Employed as the object-relational mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the database and manage data persistence.

- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): The graphical framework used for creating the user interface, including windows, controls, and data binding.

- XAML: The markup language used to define the user interface elements in WPF.
